    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Interpreted languages execute code line by line through an interpreter (e.g., Python). They do not produce a separate executable file.\n",
    "Compiled languages translate the entire source code into machine code (binary) using a compiler before execution (e.g., C++).\n",
    "Pros of interpreted: easier debugging and platform independence.\n",
    "Pros of compiled: faster execution and optimized performance.\n",

    "# 2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to handle runtime errors gracefully without crashing the program. \n",
    "It uses keywords like try, except, else, finally to manage errors.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. \n",
    "It is used to release resources or perform cleanup actions, such as closing files or network connections.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file = open(\"test.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. What is logging in Python?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Logging in Python is a way to record events, errors, and informational messages during program execution. \n",
    "It is helpful for debugging and monitoring. The logging module provides different levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n",
    "logging.info(\"This is an informational message\")\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "The __del__ method is a destructor method in Python, called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected). \n",
    "It is used to release resources or cleanup.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __del__(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Object is being destroyed\")\n",
    "obj = MyClass()\n",

    "# 6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "import imports the entire module, and you access its members using the module name.\n",
    "from ... import imports specific members directly, allowing direct access.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "import math\n",
    "print(math.sqrt(16))\n",
    "\n",
    "from math import sqrt\n",
    "print(sqrt(16))\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "You can handle multiple exceptions using multiple except blocks or a single except block with a tuple of exceptions.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = int(\"abc\")\n",
    "except (ValueError, TypeError):\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input\")\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "The with statement ensures that resources like files are properly closed after their block is executed, even if an error occurs.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "with open(\"test.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    data = file.read()\n",
    "# File is automatically closed here.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Multithreading uses multiple threads within the same process to perform tasks concurrently. It is suitable for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "Multiprocessing uses multiple processes, each with its memory space. It is suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "from threading import Thread\n",
    "from multiprocessing import Process\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "1. Debugging: Helps trace errors.\n",
    "2. Monitoring: Tracks application behavior and performance.\n",
    "3. Persistent Records: Keeps logs for future reference.\n",
    "4. Adjustable Levels: Allows filtering messages (e.g., only warnings).\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Python handles memory management automatically using reference counting and garbage collection. \n",
    "Developers do not manually allocate/deallocate memory.\n",
    "Key features: dynamic allocation, object pooling, and garbage collection.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "1. Write the code inside a try block.\n",
    "2. Catch exceptions using except blocks.\n",
    "3. Optionally use an else block for code executed if no exceptions occur.\n",
    "4. Use a finally block for cleanup.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Efficient memory management prevents memory leaks, ensures smooth program execution, and optimizes resource usage.\n",
    "Python's garbage collector automatically manages unused memory.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "The try block contains code that may raise an exception.\n",
    "The except block catches and handles exceptions, preventing program crashes.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Python's garbage collection system identifies and reclaims unused memory using:\n",
    "1. Reference counting: Deletes objects with zero references.\n",
    "2. Cyclic garbage collector: Removes objects with circular references.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "The else block executes code only if no exceptions occur in the try block. It is used for code that should run after successful execution.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "1. DEBUG: Detailed information for diagnosing issues.\n",

    "# 18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- os.fork() creates a new process by duplicating the current process. It is Unix-specific.\n",

    "# 19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",

    "\n",
    "# 20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
